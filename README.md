This mod adds custom AI threads that allows a ploppable to function as a growable. 

Things are currently in beta mode, so any feedback on problems and issues would be greatly appreciated. 

The mod is based on Boformers Sub-Buildings Enabler mod, and will not corupt or damage saves. 

When installed and activated, the mod will add a growable sub building to compatible unique building assets. When the mod is uninstalled or deactivated, the sub buildings will load as harmless dummy objects. They can be reactivated by re enabling the mod and reloading the scene. The unique buildings are not altered by the mod, and work fine with or without the mod. 

To view the growable sub building info panel, click the blue button just above the unique building info panel. 

Thanks to Boformer and EMF, whose code makes up the backbone of this mod. ServiceInfoWindow is based on EMF's Extended Building Info mod, and Sub-Building Enabler was writen by Boformer with a few minor additions for this mod.
